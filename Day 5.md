## Protocols and Models
#### Message Timing
* Flow Control - Process of managing the rate of data transmission
* Response Timeout - If person asks question and doesnt get an answer, it will react accordingly
* Access Method - Determines when someone can send a message
#### Protocol Types
* Network Communcation - Enable 2 or more devices to communicate with eachother over one or more networks
* Network Security - Secure data to provice authentication, security, and data encryption
* Routing - Enables routers to exchange information (OSPF, BGP)
* Service Discovery - Used for automatic detection of devices or services (DHCP, DNS)
#### Protocol Suits
* Apple Talk - Came out 1985 and ended in 1995 to tcp/ip
* IPX - Switched to tcp/ip in 1985
#### Protocol Sections
* Application Layer - Name system, Host config, Email, File Transfer, Web and Web service
* Transport Layer - TCP/UDP
* Internet Layer - Internet protocol, Messaging (ICMP), Routing protocols
* Network Access Layer - Address Resolution, Data Link protocols (Ethernet, WLAN)
- Open Standard Protocol - Anybody can use it (Publicly available)
- Standards=based protocol suits - Endorsed by networking industry
#### Standards Organizations
* IEEE - Electrical Engineering and Electronics (802.11, 802.3, ect.)
* IANA - IP Address management
* IETF - maintains and updates TCP/IP technologies
* ICANN - Coordinates IP address allocation and the management of domain names (Boss of IANA)
* ITU - Video compression and broadband connections (Oldest open standards body)
* TIA - Cabling Standards and physical equiptment standards (Works together with EIA)
#### OSI Model and TCP/IP Model
* Application  -  Application
* Presentation -  Application
* Session      -  Application
* Transport    -  Transport
* Network      -  Internet
* Data Link    -  Network Access
* Physical     -  Network Access
