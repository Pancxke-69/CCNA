* A: Bandwidth
##
* Q: Which media communication type does not require media arbitration in the data link layer?
* A: Full-duplex
##
* Q: During the encapsulation process, what occurs at the data link layer for a PC connected to an Ethernet network?
* A: The physical address is added.
##
* Q: Which statement is true about the CSMA/CD access method that is used in Ethernet?
* A: All network devices must listen before transmitting.
##
* Q: What three items are contained in an Ethernet header and trailer?
* A: Destination MAC address
* A: Source MAC address
* A: Error-checking information
##
* Q: Which two statements describe the services provided by the data link layer?
* A: It packages various Layer 3 PDUs into a frame format that is compatible with the network interface.
* A: It manages the access of frames to the network media.
##
* Q: What is the function of the CRC value that is found in the FCS field of a frame?
* A: To verify the integrity of the received frame.

* Q: What are two actions performed by a Cisco switch?
* A: Utilizing the MAC address table to forward frames via the destination MAC address.
* A: Using the source MAC addresses of frames to build and maintain a MAC address table.

* Q: Which two statements describe features or functions of the logical link control sublayer in Ethernet standards?
* A: The data link layer uses LLC to communicate with the upper layers of the protocol suite.
* A: Logical link control is implemented in software.

* Q: A Layer 2 switch is used to switch incoming frames from a 1000BASE-T port to a port connected to a 100Base-T network. Which method of memory buffering would work best for this task?
* A: Shared memory buffering

* Q: What is the auto-MDIX feature?
* A: It enables a device to automatically configure an interface to use a straight-through or a crossover Ethernet cable connection.

* Q: What action will occur if a switch receives a frame with the destination MAC address 01:00:5E:00:00:D9?
* A: The switch forwards it out all ports except the ingress port.

* Q: With the use of unshielded twisted-pair copper wire in a network, what causes crosstalk within the cable pairs?
* A: The magnetic field around the adjacent pairs of wire.

* Q: A network administrator is measuring the transfer of bits across the company backbone for a mission-critical financial application. The administrator notices that the network throughput appears lower than the bandwidth expected. Which three factors could influence the differences in throughput?
* A: The amount of traffic that is currently crossing the network.
* A: The type of traffic that is crossing the network.
* A: The latency that is created by the number of network devices that the data is crossing.

* Q: What does the term "attenuation" mean in data communication?
* A: Loss of signal strength as distance increases.

* Q: What is a rollover cable?
* A: A cable with a reversed pinout used to connect a computer or terminal to the console port of a network device for configuration.

* Q: A Layer 2 switch is used to switch incoming frames from a 1000BASE-T port to a port connected to a 100Base-T network. Which method of memory buffering would work best for this task?
* A: Shared memory buffering

* Q: What is the purpose of the FCS field in a frame?
* A: To determine if errors occurred in the transmission and reception.
