- [x] UDP is a low overhead protocol that does not provide sequencing or flow control mechanisms.  
- [x] UDP relies on application layer protocols for error detection.  
---
### Which two types of applications are best suited for UDP? (Choose two.)
- [x] applications that can tolerate some data loss, but require little or no delay

---
### Which factor determines TCP window size?
- [x] the amount of data the destination can process at one time  
---
### What are two roles of the transport layer in data communication on a network? (Choose two.)
- [x] tracking the individual communication between applications on the source and destination hosts  
- [x] providing the interface between applications and the underlying network over which messages are transmitted  
---
### What kind of port must be requested from IANA in order to be used with a specific application?
- [x] registered port  
---
### Which scenario describes a function provided by the transport layer?
- [x] A student has two web browser windows open in order to access two web sites. The transport layer ensures the correct web page is delivered to the correct browser window.  
---
### Which three layers of the OSI model provide similar network services to those provided by the application layer of the TCP/IP model? (Choose three.)
- [x] presentation layer  
- [x] application layer

- [x] 4501  
---
### Which layer in the TCP/IP model is used for formatting, compressing, and encrypting data?

- [x] FTP  
---
### Which OSI layer provides the interface between the applications used to communicate and the underlying network over which messages are transmitted?
- [x] application  
---
### What do the client/server and peer-to-peer network models have in common?
- [x] Both models support devices in server and client roles.  
---
### What is an example of network communication that uses the client-server model?
- [x] A workstation initiates a DNS request when the user types www.cisco.com in the address bar of a web browser.  
---
